    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the users. The aim is to reduce complexity and increase code readability by presenting a simplified version of the underlying structure.\n",

    "An example of abstraction can be seen in the use of classes in OOP. Consider a class \"Car\" which has multiple attributes such as make, model, year, and color, and methods like start, stop, and accelerate. The user of the class only needs to know about the methods and attributes to be able to operate the car, but the implementation details of how the methods perform their tasks is hidden from them. This reduces complexity for the user and allows for easier code maintenance and updates by the implementation team."

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). While they are often used interchangeably, they have distinct differences:\n",

    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential information to the user. The aim of abstraction is to reduce complexity and increase code readability by presenting a simplified version of the underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and functions within a single unit (e.g. an object). The data is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through a well-defined interface (e.g. public methods). Encapsulation helps to achieve data hiding and protection, and makes code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a class \"Bank Account\" which has two attributes, \"balance\" and \"account_number,\" and three methods, \"deposit,\" \"withdraw,\" and \"check_balance.\" Here, the abstraction is achieved by showing only the necessary information (e.g. deposit, withdraw, check_balance) to the user and hiding the implementation details of how these methods affect the balance. Encapsulation is achieved by wrapping the data (balance and account_number) and the methods (deposit, withdraw, check_balance) within a single unit (the Bank Account class), and making the data private and accessible only through the methods."

    "The \"abc\" (Abstract Base Class) module in Python is a module that provides support for defining abstract base classes. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but serves as a base class for one or more derived classes. The idea behind abstract base classes is to provide a way to define a common interface for a set of related classes, while leaving the implementation of the individual classes up to the derived classes.\n",

    "The \"abc\" module provides the \"ABC\" class which can be used as a base class for creating abstract base classes. When a class is derived from \"ABC,\" it becomes an abstract base class and can be used to define an abstract interface that must be implemented by its derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"abc\" module is used to enforce abstraction in Python, as it allows for the creation of classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and must be subclassed. This is useful in situations where you want to define a common interface for a set of related classes, but leave the implementation of the individual classes up to the derived classes. This helps to increase code modularity and maintainability by promoting the separation of interface and implementation."

    "Access Modifiers: Access modifiers, such as \"public,\" \"private,\" and \"protected,\" are used to control access to the attributes and methods of a class.

    "Abstract Classes: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own, but serves as a base class for one or more derived classes. An abstract class can define abstract methods, which must be implemented by the derived classes. This helps to enforce a common interface across a set of related classes.\n",
